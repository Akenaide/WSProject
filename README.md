# **WSProject**

I am currently in the developing stages of this project, which aims for fill the void left by wsdecks shutting down.

I do not wish do make any money off of the project, only for the Weiss Schwarz community to continue to grow and interact with one another.

Any time or experience you can lend are greatly appreciated.

**My goal** is to have a simplified beta version out as quickly as possible. There will be no users, or deck editing. Just decks tied to links. At that point I can release it for testing, and getting community feedback. Users, deck editing, and deck searching can come afterwards.

### Things you can do to help

* Design

   Im by no means an artistic person, so i'm open to any ideas concerning site design and branding. One of my core ideas for this project is to do away with the whole *card image appearing next to your mouse* design that most card sites do. I think it's ugly, and it stops the user from being able interact with the information being displayed. I'm currently trying a design where card information is displayed in one or two static places on the page.

* Backend
 
    My background lies in front end development. This is actually my first project using Node.js, so I have concerns about any challenges or pitfalls that may await me that I'm not aware of. So any mentor-ship with **Node** and **Mongo** would be greatly appreciated.

* Data

    ~~I haven't actually got anything planned out for populating my database with the large amount of sets that this project will need to support, so I could definitely use some help with that. Maybe the data already exists, maybe I'll have to make a scraper for heart of the cards, I haven't really given it much thought yet.~~
    Big Thanks to greatwanz for making his translation project available for me to use. 
    

* Deployment

    ~~I'll need a place to deploy this for the beta and beyond. I don't really know how much the upkeep will cost. I may have to seek funding, or someone to volunteer server space. I'm currently storing images in a 3rd party cdn. I don't know if this is my best solution or not, so some expertise on how to store large amount of images, and deliver them efficiently would be very great.
    Big thanks to pwyll for offering to help with hosting and administration
